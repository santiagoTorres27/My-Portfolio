        <p>Hi! My name is Santiago, I'm a Front-End Developer.</p>

        <p>
          Before getting into web development I studied and worked as a graphic
          designer, but after a couple of years I decided to change my life and
          started learning programming on my own, that's when I discovered that
          coding was what I really like to do. In 2019 I moved to Spain , where
          I currently live (I was born in Ecuador) to study mobile and web
          development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently looking for my first IT job, I would like to be part of
          a team where I can contribute with my knowledge and at the same time
          learn new skills and technologies that allow me to grow
          professionally.
        </p>
